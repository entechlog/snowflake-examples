# Design

- Objects are named based on [Snowflake object naming conventions](https://www.entechlog.com/blog/data/snowflake-object-naming-conventions/)
- Idea is to have 3 workspaces in terraform, say snowflake-dev, snowflake-stg and snowflake-prd
- Development and Stage deployments happen when code is merged to develop branch
- Production deployments happen only when code is merged to main branch
- Common resources like user, role requires a production merge for deployment
